# Solitare CS

## Description
I tried recreated the beloved card game Solitare using Html, CSS, JS, and jQuery. Since this is our second assignment I thought it would best to build on what i learneed from the last one. So I wanted to include state functionality, which is also a common feature of Solitare being able to undo and redo moves.

I learned i could use multpile js files and export classes/functions
## Compiling
Just go to the [site](https://pages.github.iu.edu/mfalana/CSCI43700_summer23_A2/) and play around.
 
#### Notes
The solitare game is not finished but you can move your mouse around on the canvas, draw a card, and flip some as well
