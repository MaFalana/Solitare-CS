# Solitare CS

## Description
I tried recreated the beloved card game Solitare using Html, CSS, JS, and jQuery. Since this is our second assignment I thought it would best to build on what i learneed from the last one. So I wanted to include state functionality, which is also a common feature of Solitare being able to undo and redo moves.
